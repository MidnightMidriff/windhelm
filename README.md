# About Windhelm
Windhelm is a text based, story driven RPG game developed in Batch Script for the Windows operating system.

Explore the Iridescent forest and discover the unique magics that have kept Windhelm safe from the outside world. Encounter shards of others souls, attempt to help them or use them for your own gain.

### Endings
As of version Beta 2.0 [ 240418-B1.BE2.GU0 ], there are no endings. However, there are several planned endings further in development.

## Downloading
This repo is in active development. A side effect of this is that at any time, if you were to download the repo as-is you may get a broken version of Windhelm. Which is why I suggest you get Windhelm from the
