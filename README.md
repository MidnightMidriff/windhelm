# About Windhelm Nightly
This branch recieves updates every time I'm done tweakin' stuff. That means that it is inherently unstable (like this entire project) but also entire parts of the game might just... not work.
If you're looking to contribute, do it from the main branch.

### Endings
As of version Beta 2.0 [ 240418-B2R.GU0 ], there are no endings. However, there are several planned endings further in development.

## Downloading
This repo is in active development. A side effect of this is that at any time, if you were to download the repo as-is you may get a broken version of Windhelm. Which is why I suggest you get Windhelm from the
[releases page ___only___](https://github.com/merelymae/windhelm/releases).
